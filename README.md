# Blockchain Test Lab

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple blockchain, which serves as a learning project to understand the inner workings of a blockchain. The code is written in Python 3 and uses the hashlib and time libraries for hashing and timestamping, respectively.

It includes a Block class representing each block in the chain, a proof-of-work function that adds a nonce value until its hash meets a certain condition, and functions to create a new block and a new blockchain with a specified number of blocks. The project also includes functions to print out the entire blockchain to a .txt file and to visualize the blockchain with index, data, and hash values.

The project is intended for my own educational purposes of better understanding blockchain tech so it's not perfect.
